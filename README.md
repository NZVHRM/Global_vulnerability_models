# Volcano Vulnerability Models Repository
## Overview
This repository houses a comprehensive compilation of volcano vulnerability models in a CSV file format. We hope this collection will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers, volcanologists, risk scientists, and anyone else interested in studying and understanding the impacts of volcanic activities on various elements such as buildings, infrastructure, and humans. The repository is intented to be a community maintained project, and we are continuously looking for contributions from the community to keep the database up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible.

## Repository Contents
Global_vulnerability_models.csv: This is the main CSV file that contains a wide range of volcano vulnerability models from various sources. Each row represents a unique model, with numerous columns detailing specific features of each model.

## Data Description
Global_vulnerability_models.csv file includes, but is not limited to, the following columns:

* Sector_class: The high level sector class that model covers (e.g., energy sector, building sector).
* Asset_class: A sub-class of the sector class (e.g., residential buildings).
* Component_class: If the model only considers one component of a broader system (e.g., roofs for buildings, insulators for electricity lines). 
* Component_specific: Specific considerations for the component (e.g., high voltage vs low voltage power lines).
* Specific_typology_class: The specific classification the model uses. This is reported as published. 
* Model_Type: The type vulnerability model (e.g., fragility function, vulnerability function).
* Derivation_method: The underpinning method the model was developed using (e.g., empirical, expert ellicitation, hybrid).
* Hazard_family: The hazard the model is applicable for. 
* HIM_class: The hazard intensity metric used for the model.
* Hazard_context: Any specific context that the model considers (e.g., wet compacted tephra, density of pyroclastic flow density). 
* Risk_metric_family: The type of risk metric the model outputs (damage, loss etc).
* Risk_metric_class: The specific type of metric used (e.g., Damage ratio, Damage state)
* Risk_metric_context: Additional contextual information to explain the risk metric.
* States: How many states are used if the risk metric uses damage/impact states. 
* Uncertainty: Boolean yes/no as to whether the model explicitely captures uncertainty
* Uncertainty_type: The type of uncertainty the model uses (e.g., lognormal distribution)
* Data_type: Whether the data of the risk metric is qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative.
* Published_retrospective_evaluation: Has the model been retrospectively evaluated with published resuts?
* Benchmarking: Has the model been benchmarked against other compariable models?
* Published: The publication of the model.
* Year: The year in which the model was published.
* Link: Link to the publication.
* Opensource_code: Is there any opensource code available for the model?
* Link_to_code: A link to any opensource code for the model that is available.

Note: The list and fields may be adjusted or removed in future to adapt to changing needs of the community.
