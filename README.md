# Volcano Vulnerability Models Repository
## Overview
This repository houses a comprehensive compilation of volcano vulnerability models in a CSV file format. We hope this collection will serve as an invaluable resource for researchers, volcanologists, risk scientists, and anyone else interested in studying and understanding the impacts of volcanic activities on various elements such as buildings, infrastructure, and humans. The repository is intented to be a community maintained project, and we are continuously looking for contributions from the community to keep the database up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible.

## Repository Contents
Global_vulnerability_models.csv: This is the main CSV file that contains a wide range of volcano vulnerability models from various sources. Each row represents a unique model, with numerous columns detailing specific features of each model.

## Data Description
Global_vulnerability_models.csv file includes, but is not limited to, the following columns:

* Sector_class: The high level sector class that model covers (e.g., energy sector, building sector).
* Asset_class: A sub-class of the sector class (e.g., residential buildings).
* Model_Type: The type vulnerability model (e.g., fragility function, vulnerability function).
* Derivation_method: The underpinning method the model was developed using (e.g., empirical, expert ellicitation, hybrid).
* Hazard_family: The hazard the model is applicable for. 
* Risk_metric: The type of risk metric the model outputs.
* Uncertainty: Boolean yes/no as to whether the model explicitely captures uncertainty
* Uncertainty_type: The type of uncertainty the model uses (e.g., lognormal distribution)
* Year: The year in which the model was published.
* Publication: The publication the model was published in.
* Link_to_code: A link to any opensource code for the model that is available.

Note: This is not an exhaustive list and fields may be added or removed in future to adapt to changing needs of the community.
